## Overview

This research explores novel extensions of the classic Tower of Hanoi algorithm through the lens of graph theory, fractal structures, and discrete mathematics. The paper presents:

- Optimized recursive algorithms for the 4-peg Tower of Hanoi problem with improved time complexity.
- A detailed study of Hanoi graphs and their relationship with well-known mathematical constructs such as the Sierpiński triangle and Pascal's triangle.
- Applications of group theory and higher-dimensional projections in modeling state transitions and identifying algorithmic symmetries.

## Contents

- `Discrete_Math_paper_group26.pdf`: Full research paper.
- Graph diagrams and visualizations illustrating Hanoi graphs, Sierpiński isomorphisms, and recursive decompositions.
- Algorithm pseudocode and complexity analysis for naive and optimized solutions.

## Key Topics

- Recursive algorithm design and optimization  
- Graph theory (Hanoi state graphs, cliques, shortest paths)  
- Fractal geometry and mathematical induction  
- Group theory and symmetry in discrete systems  
- Computational complexity analysis  
- Applications in high-dimensional topology and combinatorics
